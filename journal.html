        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">How we started</span><p><span class="headline hl2">Ole Rieken and Saria Mostafa</span></p></div>We have always been fascinated by the natural sciences, even becoming "Juniorstudenten" at the university of Hamburg (UHH).</p>
            <p>Yet, it has always been the case that in science, there are very few things you can do on your own. So, getting together a team of passionate and well-versed people together, to learn and push the boundary of what is possible seemed to be the most logical course of action.</p>
            <p>Thus, we started Nebulight. To accomplish exactly what we have always wanted, getting a group of cool people together to create and learn together, to push our limits, to become the future of science.</p></div>
       
        
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Repurposing old hardware</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by Nebulight</span></p></div><p>
            At Nebulight, we're committed to pushing the boundaries of innovation while also minimizing our environmental footprint. That's why we're proud to share our approach to repurposing used, broken, and damaged hardware to build upon our equipment, contributing to a more sustainable future.</p>
        
        <p>Rather than discarding hardware that is no longer functional or deemed obsolete, we see potential in every piece of equipment. <span class="citation">Join us and donate your hardware by contacting us!</span>  Through careful assessment and refurbishment, our team of engineers and technicians works tirelessly to salvage and repurpose hardware components, breathing new life into old technology.<p>

            <p>Repurposing hardware offers a multitude of benefits. Not only does it reduce electronic waste and lessen the strain on natural resources, but it also allows us to save costs and extend the lifespan of our equipment. Additionally, by repurposing hardware, we're able to tap into a diverse range of components and materials, fostering creativity and innovation in our projects.</p>
