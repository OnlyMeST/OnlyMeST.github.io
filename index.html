      <h2>Research Topics;</h2>
      <p>At Nebulight, we strive for researching complex and niche topics, ranging from astrophysics to biomedical engineering. We mainly use computer simulations powered by machine learning algorithms to create theoretical frameworks for further research, lessening our need for specialized equipment, and giving us our own data. <br>Some of the topics we are working on are:  <br><br>- Investigating the Morphological and Dynamical Evolution of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in Galaxy Clusters. <br><br>- Investigating Novel Approaches to Non-Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for Neuroprosthetics and Augmented Cognition. <br><br>- Quantum Algorithm Development for Solving NP-Hard Optimization Problems.</p>
