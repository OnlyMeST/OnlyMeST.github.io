      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I am Saria. I do a lot of things: I am a 16-year-old programmer with a passion for technology and creativity. My skills range from website development to game design and encryption. I have developed websites myself and created games for multiple game jams. I am also interested in cryptography and have been a member of a team that participates in online encryption challenges.

        In addition to programming, I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes. I am fascinated by the laws of physics and enjoy exploring scientific concepts in my free time. I also have a passion for writing, specifically world building, and have created several fictional worlds and their corresponding histories.
        
        Currently, I am working on establishing my own scientific club to share my knowledge and interests with others. I am driven by a desire to learn and grow, and I am constantly seeking out new challenges to improve my skills and expand my horizons. </p>
